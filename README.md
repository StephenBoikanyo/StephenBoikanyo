## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring full Stack Developer with 5 years of programming experience, split between contractual and full time employment. I am predominantly selftaught. I have been a Computer Science major at the University Of the Western Cape in Cape Town,South Africa since 2018. I am currently building an interesting portofolio filled with a great range of projects to prove my competency as a developer to attract recruiters and clients. One of my bigggest aspirations is to work for a FAANG company before retring in tech.
